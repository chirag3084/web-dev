write a javascript  code for good website 

As an AI language model, I can give you some general guidelines on what makes a good website and some tips on how to implement them using JavaScript. However, it's important to note that creating a good website requires a lot more than just JavaScript. You need to consider factors such as user experience, design, content, and search engine optimization. Here are some tips to get you started:

Keep your website fast: Nobody likes a slow website, so it's important to optimize your website's performance. You can use JavaScript to minify your code, lazy load images and videos, and reduce HTTP requests. Here's an example of how to lazy load images using JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
const images = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]');

function lazyLoad() {
  images.forEach((img) => {
    if (img.getBoundingClientRect().top < window.innerHeight) {
      img.src = img.dataset.src;
      img.removeAttribute('data-src');
    }
  });
}

window.addEventListener('scroll', lazyLoad);
Make your website responsive: Your website should look good and function well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. You can use JavaScript to create responsive navigation menus, adjust the layout based on the screen size, and optimize the images and videos for different devices.
javascript
Copy code
const toggleBtn = document.querySelector('.toggle-btn');
const navMenu = document.querySelector('.nav-menu');

toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  navMenu.classList.toggle('active');
});
Use animations and visual effects sparingly: Animations and visual effects can make your website more engaging, but they can also slow down your website and distract users from the content. Use them sparingly and make sure they enhance the user experience rather than detract from it. You can use JavaScript to create animations and visual effects, such as scrolling animations, hover effects, and sliders.
javascript
Copy code
const slider = document.querySelector('.slider');
const prevBtn = document.querySelector('.prev-btn');
const nextBtn = document.querySelector('.next-btn');

let index = 0;

nextBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  index++;
  if (index > 2) {
    index = 0;
  }
  slider.style.transform = `translateX(-${index * 100}%)`;
});

prevBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  index--;
  if (index < 0) {
    index = 2;
  }
  slider.style.transform = `translateX(-${index * 100}%)`;
});
Make your website accessible: Your website should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. You can use JavaScript to add keyboard navigation, improve the contrast and readability of the content, and provide alternative text for images and videos.
javascript
Copy code
const menuLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.menu-link');

menuLinks.forEach((link) => {
  link.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.keyCode === 13 || event.keyCode === 32) {
      event.preventDefault();
      link.click();
    }
  });
});
Test your website: Before launching your website, make sure to test it thoroughly on different browsers and devices. You can use JavaScript to automate the testing process and catch any errors or issues.
javascript
Copy code
const form = document.querySelector('form');
const emailInput = document.querySelector('#email');
const messageInput = document.querySelector('#message');
const submitBtn = document.querySelector('#submit');

form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (emailInput.value === '' || messageInput.value === '') {
    alert('Please fill out all fields.');
  } else {
    submitBtn.disabled = true;
    submitBtn.textContent = 'Submitting...';
    // Send the form data
